# Hello Peeps,

And welcome to my TED-talk. This markdown will tell you how to run this wonderfully awesome and beautiful application on your very own personal computer. How cool is _that_! I had a blast doing this so thank you.

## To run the application

1. In case you are not a javascript ninja but a ninja of another flavour, you shall need to overcome this first trial by installing the newest version of [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Navigate to the main folder (Quizzically) in any terminal of your choosing (I think). Like a true pro, enter the following: `$ npm i`
3. Look at you go, you're a natural. Follow that up with `$ npm start` to run the application.
4. If you did all of the above correctly (I have zero doubts), you can now navigate to the [app](http://localhost:3000/) to play the game. Enjoy, it is truly a glorious experience.

## To run the tests

1. I am going to assume you followed the previous steps. If you did not, please see 'To run the application' above. Thanks.
2. To run the tests, enter the command `$ npm run test`.
3. The API might be sad. I wash my hands of that whole situation.
